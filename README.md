# thermoregulatory_morphodynamics
This repository contains the raw data from the paper "Thermoregulatory morphodynamics of honeybee swarm clusters."

The following files contain data related to the morphological responses of honeybee swarm clusters to temperature ramp experiments conducted with 3 heating and cooling reates:

treatment_1_github_file.csv
treatment_2_github_file.csv
treatment_3_github_file.csv

The following files contain the temeperature measurements within swarm clusters during these temeprature ramp experiments:
